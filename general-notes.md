# General Notes

## Pros
- Easily able to share data from base to base and table to table.
- Interface is clean, not flashy looking though
- It is possible to have almost everything done from an interface (though there may need to be occasional visits to the database as it might not be perfect and it will be hard to make everything 100% part of the interface) 
- It has several interfaces (such as calendar, gallery, list, ect.). unsure if this is part of smartsheets though
- has extensions that can print or email autoformatted things.
- template + automations can do a lot.

## Cons
- If you have a formula for a specific column (field) you are unable to make further edits to the  column easily. Additionally, it is difficult to create unique boxes inside a field (column). 
- There is only a certain way to link tables, and with this method, you are unable to change values. There are 2 ways around this, either develop an automation system that links things or you have separate override fields that you use to override these fields. Both options are time consuming, and the latter is not user friendly.
-  Summing together data requires a workaround as you cannot sum data (from a column) and put it into a slot on the same table. In order to do this, you must 2 more fields, one that links to the designated field, and another to sum up those values that you select with the field.
- Interface is very limited in what you can do. Many workarounds but it will not look flashy and may not be the best organized. Additionally, it will be hard to implement the same amount of data that is on smartsheet to airtable
- Pro plan is per person/per workspace (unsure if I will need it by the end of the project)
- Little table organization, must be smart and efficient the way one structures data. It will be hard to add more to the database once it is established. Additionally, there is a limited number of airtable syncs (20 per base no matter the plan) meaning that I do not think it is possible to recreate the entirety of smartsheet onto airtable, as you cannot conglomerate data into a large overall folder. You can sync more airtable data through other programs such as unito or zapier, which also cost money (unsure of the limitations of those other websites though). Unito can connect airtable to smartsheets though, 
- Does occasionally get slow (i'm unsure if that is my computer or not). Additionally, the automations are not automatic so if you are filling data fast, it will not keep up with you. 
- Not as flexible to how you can structure a table (limited colors, only can edit columns) 
- Automations Cost Money, same with scripting for automations (only able to do with enterprise plan)
- Templates only have 100 Records limit, cannot be used for widespread usage of templates of rooms;. To increase limit, a enterprise plan is needed. 
- Airtableâ€™s automations can only have up to 25 actions in them, you can only have 50 automations in a base, and you can only find up to 100 records in an action. Syncing has major limitations as well.
