## Summary
This airtable base is designed to be a template of the "Estimating and Invoicing" folder in Smartsheet. It specifically mimics the functionality of the Database/Worksheet/Estimating Summary while improving the BOM creation/modification process as well as organizing its structure. Though it is detached from smartsheet, its interface is orgnaized in such a way which one can easily extract essential data, minimzing the time to transfer data from smartsheet to airtable.

## Overall Thoughts
I do not believe that airtable has the capacity to replicate smartsheet's functionality completely but I do think it improves on the efficiency of the BOM. Here are some of the main reasons why it cannot replicate smartsheet:
* Individual cells cannot be edited if there is a formula already established in a column (field). This significantly reduces the flexibility of the database, which is something I think is essential to CIT after previewing smartsheets databases.
* The organizational structure of airtable does not allow for a large folder structure. There is more information about this in the airtable guide: however, it will be extremely hard and convoluted for one to try and replicate a similar structure to smartsheets in airtable.
* Airtable is overall not flexible and one must find many workarounds to a certian task (such as summing up a column). While this is easy in smartsheets, it requires a large amount of effort in airtable. These workarounds make the base extremely convoluted and is not practical when dealing with the entirety of the CIT smartsheet folder structure.
