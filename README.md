## Summary
This airtable base is designed to be a template of the "Estimating and Invoicing" folder in Smartsheet. It specifically mimics the functionality of the Database/Worksheet/Estimating Summary while improving the BOM creation/modification process as well as organizing its structure. Though it is detached from smartsheet, its interface is orgnaized in such a way which one can easily extract essential data, minimzing the time to transfer data from smartsheet to airtable.

## Overall Thoughts
I do not believe that airtable has the capacity to replicate smartsheet's functionality completely but I do think it improves on the efficiency of the BOM. Here are some of the main reasons why it cannot replicate smartsheet:
* Individual cells cannot be edited if there is a formula already established in a column (field). This significantly reduces the flexibility of the database, which is something I think is essential to CIT after previewing smartsheets databases.
* The organizational structure of airtable does not allow for a large folder structure. There is more information about this in the airtable guide: however, it will be extremely hard and convoluted for one to try and replicate a similar structure to smartsheets in airtable.
* Airtable is overall not flexible and one must find many workarounds to a certian task (such as summing up a column). While this is easy in smartsheets, it requires a large amount of effort in airtable. These workarounds make the base extremely convoluted and is not practical when dealing with the entirety of the CIT smartsheet folder structure.

## Previous Versions
Found in the [Airtable Version History](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invLk2Vwum3U4G3mt&inviteToken=28f8b601579fb2332c8ecc50279d4682e38827385a1daf961731ef2e6ec0f092&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts) workspace, the several versions keep track of the airtable development process. V4 is extremely similar to the final, only has minor changes such as an additional automation that does not work, while V0-V2 are vastly different.
